Well... Hi there.
As you could have probably guessed my name is Itamar Zam,
I am currently 17 years old, trying to enrich my knowledge with everything that revolves around computers.
I am also currently working on growing my projects portfolio, with interest in Data Science, Deep Learning and Python.
If you are also in my position or even in a better one and you would like to discuss and network, hit me up!
Have a wonderful day, random guy.
